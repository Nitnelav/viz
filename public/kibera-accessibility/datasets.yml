  description: This layer shows the accessibilities of commercial areas by walking
    in Nairobi, Kenya. It does not necessarily show where actual commercial activites
    take place, but areas that are reserved for commercial activities in terms of
    official land-use zoning. The computation is based on input data from OpenStreetMap
    and official land-use data.

  name: Clinic Walk Accessibility
  description: This layer shows the walk accessibilities of clinics by walking in
    the slum of Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. The computation is exclusively based on input
    data from OpenStreetMap. For the "Live" data, the whole process of data retrieval,
    computation, and publication is re-done once a day automatically so that changes
    due to potential infrastructure alterations are automatically taken into account.

  description: This layer shows the accessibilities of publicly accessible drinking
    water taps by walking in the slum of Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. For the "live" data,
    data retrieval, computation, and publication is re-done once a day automatically
    so that changes due to potential infrastructure alterations are automatically
    taken into account. The breakdown scenario case study assumes that 57 taps have
    broken down due to e.g. a pipe break. The computation is exclusively based on
    input data from OpenStreetMap.
