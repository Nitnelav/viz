# MATSim-Viz

This project is about visualizing MATSim result data.

## Set up development environment

The project is a browser application which uses the following techniques:

* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) as programming language
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) as a view framework
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating language

The recomended editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To make it play nicely whith the above techniques the following plugins should be installed:

* Vetur for VueJS components
* ESLint for ES-Lint support
* TSLint for TS-Lint support
* TSLint Vue for linting VueJS-Components written in Typescript
* Prettier to auto format code according to the linting rules.
* To enable auto formatting on save add `"editor.formatOnSave": true` in the user settings
